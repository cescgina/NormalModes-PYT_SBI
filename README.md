### PyEDA

In this project we have developed PyEDA, a python based software capable of analyzing Normal Modes from NMR structures and MD trajectories in pdb format. It uses an Essential Dynamics approach and it gives different outputs like a structure pdb file with the superimposed structures, the eigenvalues in increasing order, the fluctuations of the structure by residue and a final structure with the main motions of defined normal modes applied. It can be used as a python Package,  with a tkinter interface and also as a CLI standalone program.
