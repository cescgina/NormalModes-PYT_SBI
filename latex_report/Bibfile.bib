@article{Amadei1993,
abstract = {Analysis of extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an "essential" subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as "physically constrained." If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space.},

abstract = {Application of the "essential dynamics" method to the NMR cluster of structures for the R2R3 DNA-binding domain of the mouse c-Myb transcriptional activator is described. Using this method, large concerted fluctuations of atoms are extracted showing a hinge-bending motion between the two (R2 and R3) Myb repeats on the basis of NMR data alone. Molecular dynamics simulation of the same protein allowed quantitative comparison of the large concerted motions calculated from experimental and theoretical data, showing a significant degree of similarity. Detailed inspection of the motions reveals a conserved proline that plays a key role in determining hinge flexibility. The proline-to-alanine mutation at this position, which has previously been characterized biochemically, was subjected to molecular dynamics and subsequent essential dynamics analysis. The hinge-bending motion between the two repeats was found to be enhanced for the mutant. The approach described should have general applications, predicting the effect of mutations on protein dynamic properties of other proteins.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the activation domain of porcine procarboxypeptidase B (ADBp) were performed to examine the effect of using the particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) or the reaction field (RF) method for calculating electrostatic interactions in simulations of highly charged proteins. Several structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic observables were derived from the MD trajectories, including estimated entropies and solvation free energies and essential dynamics (ED). The P3M method leads to slightly higher atomic positional fluctuations and deviations from the crystallographic structure, along with somewhat lower values of the total energy and solvation free energy. However, the ED analysis of the system leads to nearly identical results for both simulations. Because of the strong similarity between the results, both methods appear well suited for the simulation of highly charged globular proteins in explicit solvent. However, the lower computational demand of the RF method in the present implementation represents a clear advantage over the P3M method.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a leading method for studying long-time dynamics and elasticity of biomolecules. The method proceeds from complex semiempirical potentials characterizing the covalent and noncovalent interactions between atoms. It is widely accepted that such detailed potentials are essential to the success of NMA's. We show that a single-parameter potential is sufficient to reproduce the slow dynamics in good detail. Costly and inaccurate energy minimizations are eliminated, permitting direct analysis of crystal coordinates. The technique can be used for new applications, such as mapping of one crystal form to another by means of slow modes, and studying anomalous dynamics of large proteins and complexes.},

abstract = {The DNA-binding region of Myb consists of three imperfect tandem repeats (R1, R2, and R3). We have determined the solution structure of a specific DNA complex of the minimum DNA-binding domain (R2R3) by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR. Both R2 and R3 contain three helices, and the third helix in each is found to be a recognition helix. R2 and R3 are closely packed in the major groove, so that the two recognition helices contact each other directly to bind to the specific base sequence, AACNG cooperatively; this is a significant arrangement of recognition helices. The three key base pairs in this sequence are specifically recognized by Asn-183 (R3), Lys-182 (R3), and Lys-128 (R2). In contrast, R1 has no specific interactions with DNA from our NMR study of the DNA complex of the full DNA-binding domain (R1R2R3).},
